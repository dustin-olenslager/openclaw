# 🦾 IronClaw Supreme — Production-Hardened OpenClaw Fork

A production-hardened fork of [OpenClaw](https://github.com/openclaw/openclaw) with host-level monitoring, browser process management, community skills security validation, and automated version tracking.

> **Philosophy:** IronClaw adds host-level production tooling that OpenClaw — as an application running inside Docker — cannot provide. All custom code lives in isolated directories (`scripts/`, `skills/`, `config/`) with zero modifications to OpenClaw core files.

## 🆚 IronClaw Supreme vs OpenClaw

| Area | OpenClaw | IronClaw Supreme |
|------|----------|------------------|
| **Browser Process Management** | Application-level sandbox/relay | Host-level process monitoring, cleanup, and limits |
| **Community Skills Security** | Plugin integrity checks + `--pin` | Whitelist validation against awesome-openclaw-skills + safety scoring |
| **Version Monitoring** | Manual version checks | Automated daily checks with Telegram alerts |
| **Host Health Monitoring** | None (runs inside container) | Daily optimization, health checks, Chrome monitoring |
| **Production Documentation** | General setup docs | Migration guide, production deployment guide |
| **Fork Management** | N/A | Automated upstream sync workflow |

> **Note:** OpenClaw v2026.2.19 significantly improved its built-in security (plugin pinning, SSRF guarding, browser relay auth, sandbox registry). IronClaw's value is in the **host-level layer** that complements these application-level protections.

## 🎯 Core Components

### 🖥️ Browser Hardening (`scripts/`)
Host-level Chrome/Chromium process management for containerized OpenClaw deployments:

- **`chrome-process-limiter.sh`** — Real-time monitoring with configurable process/memory limits and daemon mode
- **`enhanced-browser-cleanup-v2.sh`** — Smart process termination and resource recovery
- **`browser-health-monitor.sh`** — Periodic health checks with alerting
- **`daily-optimization.sh`** — Automated maintenance (Docker prune, log rotation, resource cleanup)
- **`health-check.js`** — Gateway endpoint health verification

```bash
# Monitor Chrome processes
./scripts/chrome-process-limiter.sh daemon

# Run cleanup
./scripts/enhanced-browser-cleanup-v2.sh

# Daily maintenance
./scripts/daily-optimization.sh

# System health check
node scripts/health-check.js
```

### 🔒 Community Skills Security (`skills/community-skills/`)
Automated validation system for community OpenClaw skills:

- Validates against [awesome-openclaw-skills](https://github.com/VoltAgent/awesome-openclaw-skills) approved repository
- GitHub metrics-based safety scoring (stars, forks, activity, license)
- Complete audit logging of installation attempts
- User confirmation required even for approved skills

```bash
cd skills/community-skills
node validate-skill.js <skill-name>
```

### 📊 Version Monitoring (`skills/ironclaw-version-monitor/`)
Automated upstream tracking with Telegram notifications:

- Daily version comparison against upstream OpenClaw releases
- Telegram alerts when updates are available
- Commit delta and changelog summary

```bash
cd skills/ironclaw-version-monitor
node version-checker.js --now

# Test Telegram notifications
node telegram-notifier.js --test
```

### 🔄 Fork Management (`scripts/update-from-upstream.sh`)
Automated upstream sync workflow:

```bash
./scripts/update-from-upstream.sh
```

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Quick Setup

```bash
# Clone this fork
git clone https://github.com/dustin-olenslager/ironclaw-supreme.git
cd ironclaw-supreme

# Follow standard OpenClaw setup
# See: https://github.com/openclaw/openclaw#getting-started

# Enable browser monitoring (optional, for production)
chmod +x scripts/*.sh
./scripts/chrome-process-limiter.sh daemon

# Set up version monitoring (optional)
cd skills/ironclaw-version-monitor
npm install
node setup.js
```

### Migrating from Vanilla OpenClaw
